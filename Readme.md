# Bridge criticality due to extreme traffic loads

This repository presents a map that is a part of the outcome of the research work titled _Estimating Bridge Criticality Due to Extreme Traffic Loads in Large Highway Networks with the Use of Probabilistic Models._ The research proposes a methodology to quantify the structural criticality of bridges at a network level.

The map serves as a visual representation of the research outcomes, illustrating the application of the proposed methodology. It provides insights into the structural criticality of 576 bridges within the national highway network of Mexico.

This visualization can be utilized to assess the condition of a bridge network and prioritize maintenance and repair activities by identifying potential bridges subjected to major load stress.
